The Gaming Room is a software development company looking to expand their current application, Draw It or Lose It. This application is currently only available for Android devices and they are looking to expand the application and develop it as a web-based application. 

In development of this documentation, I believe I excelled in understanding and defining the elements on the UML diagram. 

I found this section particularily helpful when designing and developing the code itself as the breakdown of important elements and processes provided a checklist of elements and processes needed in development. 

In revision, I would take a look at the evaluation graph. While I believe I covered all of the important points necessary in reviewing each section, I am not happy with the presentation of the information or clarity of points I was hoping to establish. 

Interpretting the user's needs came down to inspecting the requirements that they defined and combing through the details of them while hypothesizing solutions and features that would give the stakeholders the key features that they asked for. In this project, it was helpful to review the stakeholder's asks and break them down into bullets within the Requirements in the Project Software Design Document. Then, I was able to evaluate these requirements and create actionable tasks to accoplish within the Design Constraints. 

I found it helpful to utilize the steps laid out by the software design document and follow with application development accordingly. Analyzing the requests from the stakeholders, putting them into design constraints, analyzing how those design constraints can work together and eventually software development from those processes. In the future, I would like to utilize documentation like the software design document to design the requirements and use them as a step-by-step guide to development.
